It is designed to efficiently manage and execute data collection tasks. Pdata offers distributed and rapid deployment capabilities, allowing you to execute tasks, monitor logs in real-time, and track various data metrics. It is particularly suitable for scenarios requiring high scalability and stability.</p><h2 id="background-of-creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#background-of-creation"><span>Background of Creation</span></a></h2><p>The idea for Pdata originated from the need for a standardized workflow for web scraping development, as well as the desire for easier management and maintenance of scraping tasks. As a result, Pdata was developed into a system that is platform-based, supports quick deployment, real-time monitoring, and high scalability.</p><h2 id="who-is-pdata-for" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#who-is-pdata-for"><span>Who is Pdata for?</span></a></h2><ul><li><code>Web Scraping Engineers</code>: Pdata provides a unified development framework template, allowing developers to focus more on the core logic of web scraping without wasting excessive time on repetitive tasks like multi-threading, multi-processing, task queues, and message notifications.</li><li><code>DevOps Engineers</code>: With its rapid deployment capabilities, Pdata is equally beneficial for DevOps engineers. It enables quick deployment and updates of script tasks for operations, supports multi-node control, and simplifies the process with one-click deployment through Docker containers.</li><li><code>Data Analysts</code>: Data analysts can also use Pdata&#39;s quick deployment features to streamline their work, saving time otherwise spent on repetitive deployment tasks.</li><li><code>Others</code>: While Pdata is particularly adept at handling web scraping tasks, it can be used by any group seeking rapid deployment or task automation for their work.</li></ul><h2 id="key-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features"><span>Key Features</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Node</code></td><td>Node Management</td><td>Register, manage, and monitor multiple nodes in a distributed system</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Scraping Deployment</td><td>Automatically deploy web scraping tasks to multiple nodes and synchronize scripts or related files</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Scraping Code Updates</td><td>Real-time online updates and editing of script code</td></tr><tr><td><code>Scraping</code></td><td>Scraping Data Statistics</td><td>Statistics such as the number of projects &amp; tasks, completed and running tasks, and node counts</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Framework Integration</td><td>Built on the custom asynchronous concurrent distributed scraping framework <code>Single_process</code></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Data Storage Integration</td><td>Built-in middleware and ORM modules for automatic database storage with simple parameter configuration</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Task Scheduling</td><td>Distribute and schedule scraping tasks across multiple nodes in a distributed system</td></tr><tr><td><code>Task</code></td><td>Task Logs</td><td>Automatically save task logs, which can be viewed in real-time on the front-end UI</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Task Status</td><td>Visualize task status information, providing an intuitive view of task progress</td></tr><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td>User Management [WIP]</td><td>Create, update, and delete user accounts</td></tr><tr><td><code>Other</code></td><td>Message Notifications</td><td>Automatically send notifications to DingTalk when tasks are triggered or completed</td></tr></tbody></table>',9))])}const g=i(u,[["render",p],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),f=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/guide/","title":"Introduce","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduce","icon":"mdi:tooltip-text-outline","createTime":"2024/12/06 14:11:00","permalink":"/en/guide/"},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":1.57,"words":470},"git":{"updatedTime":1741000553000,"contributors":[{"name":"袁少航","username":"袁少航","email":"yuanshaohang@dataoceanai.com","commits":1,"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/袁少航?v=4","url":"https://github.com/袁少航"}]},"filePathRelative":"en/guide/README.md","bulletin":false}');export{g as comp,f as data};
