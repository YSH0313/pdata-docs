Its core concept is to leverage advanced distributed computing technologies to break down complex crawler tasks into multiple independently runnable and manageable code nodes. These nodes can be dynamically allocated and scheduled based on task requirements, significantly improving the efficiency and flexibility of the crawler system. Additionally, the platform provides an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface, enabling users to easily edit and manage nodes without requiring extensive programming knowledge, allowing them to quickly deploy efficient crawler systems.",-1),e("p",null,"In a rapidly iterating technological environment, deeply understanding how a system works is crucial for ensuring its stable and efficient operation.
