In fact, we have already planned to switch from MySQL to <code>MongoDB</code>. Why?</p><p>MongoDB is a document-oriented, distributed database system designed to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data.</p><h3 id="_1-core-concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-core-concepts"><span>1. Core Concepts</span></a></h3><ul><li><code>Document storage</code>: One of the core concepts of MongoDB is document storage. Documents are JSON-like objects containing key-value pairs, which can easily store complex and nested data structures. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB documents do not require a predefined schema, offering great flexibility and scalability.</li><li><code>Distributed</code>: MongoDB is designed as a distributed system, capable of scaling across multiple nodes and servers. This enables horizontal scaling, allowing it to handle massive amounts of data and ensuring high availability.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-key-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-key-features"><span>2. Key Features</span></a></h3><ul><li><code>Dynamic schema</code>: MongoDB documents do not require a strict schema, allowing them to adapt to changing data structures.</li><li><code>Indexes</code>: MongoDB supports indexing document fields to improve query performance.</li><li><code>Aggregation</code>: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework to summarize and analyze data from document collections.</li><li><code>MapReduce</code>: MongoDB supports MapReduce operations for parallel processing of large datasets.</li><li><code>Replication</code>: MongoDB can be configured for master-slave replication, providing data redundancy and availability.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-advantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-advantages"><span>3. Advantages</span></a></h3><ul><li><code>High performance</code>: MongoDB performs excellently when handling large volumes of data and high-concurrency requests.</li><li><code>Flexibility</code>: The document model of MongoDB offers immense flexibility, accommodating evolving data structures.</li><li><code>Scalability</code>: MongoDB can easily scale horizontally across multiple nodes and servers to handle massive data volumes.</li><li><code>Ease of use</code>: MongoDB provides a rich query language and tools, making data management and analysis simple and intuitive.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in the future, you may see us migrate from <code>MySQL</code> to <code>MongoDB</code>. You need not be surprised, as this change will bring an enhanced experience.</p>',14)]))}const l=a(i,[["render",s],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/guide/zhl29k50/","title":"Database","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Database","icon":"icon-park-outline:database-code","createTime":"2024/12/11 18:35:49","permalink":"/en/guide/zhl29k50/"},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":1.44,"words":433},"git":{"updatedTime":1741000553000,"contributors":[{"name":"袁少航","username":"袁少航","email":"yuanshaohang@dataoceanai.com","commits":1,"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/袁少航?v=4","url":"https://github.com/袁少航"}]},"filePathRelative":"en/guide/gears/4.database.md","bulletin":false}');export{l as comp,c as data};
