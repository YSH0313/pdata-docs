Resource monitoring is a service for monitoring the `performance resources` of cluster nodes, mainly focusing
on `CPU`, `memory`, `bandwidth`, and `disk`. It provides a comprehensive insight into system performance. It helps to
promptly identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, ensuring the stability and efficient operation of the system.
This allows users to quickly understand the load status of each node and make timely adjustments to usage strategies.

## Home Page

The home page mainly displays the disk usage status. When in `Healthy` status, data rows are highlighted in `green`, and
when in `Critical` status, data rows are highlighted in `red`, making it easier to observe the disk space usage status.
