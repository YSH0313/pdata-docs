PDATA can send message notifications through the `DingTalk Robot`.

It actively sends notifications to users when a `task is started`, `task is finished`,
or `task encounters an exception`.

::: warning
Currently, only system-triggered message notifications are supported, and the feature for user-defined notifications is
not yet available. We may add support for this feature in future updates.
