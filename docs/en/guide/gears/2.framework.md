Our platform adopts a layered and modular design principle, aimed at ensuring the system's scalability, maintainability, and high availability.

The layered design divides the system into clear logical layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

The modular design breaks the system into independent, reusable modules, each encapsulating a specific functionality and interacting with other modules through standardized interfaces, which improves development efficiency and system maintainability.

This design principle enables our platform to flexibly respond to changes in requirements, quickly expand new features, while maintaining system stability and reliability.
