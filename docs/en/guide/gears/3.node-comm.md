The communication performance between master and slave nodes has always been a pursuit of engineers. The widely
recognized high-performance RPC communication framework is [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), and our system also adopts this
solution to implement communication between the master and slave nodes. Additionally, we leverage gRPC's more efficient
bidirectional streaming mode.

Below is the node communication diagram in PDATA:

As you can see, the invocation relationship between the master and slave nodes is quite simple, thanks to the powerful
communication capabilities of [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The main challenge lies in writing the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
communication code, but you don’t need to worry about that, as the system has already handled it for you internally.
