## FileFlow

PDATA is an efficient distributed task management platform, utilizing the [AsyncSSH](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh) asynchronous SSHv2 protocol library to develop a master-slave file synchronization system: `FileFlow`.

[AsyncSSH](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh) is an asynchronous SSHv2 protocol library based on Python, specifically designed for asyncio. Our backend system is entirely built using asyncio for asynchronous processing, giving us a clear natural advantage.

### Features:
AsyncSSH allows developers to create secure SSH connections for remote command execution, file transfer, and port forwarding. It supports various SSH functions such as SFTP, SCP, TCP/IP port forwarding, and X11 forwarding.

### Use Cases:
AsyncSSH is particularly suitable for applications that need to utilize SSH protocols in asynchronous programming environments. For example, system administrators can easily parallelize tasks across multiple remote servers, such as updating systems or deploying software.
