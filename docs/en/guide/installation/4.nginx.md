To install Nginx on a Linux system, you can choose the installation method based on the Linux distribution you're using. Below are some common installation methods.

## Install Using System Package Manager

1. Update the package index
::: tabs
@tab :[logos:ubuntu]:ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update 
```
@tab :[devicon:centos]:centos
```bash
sudo yum update
```
:::

2. Install Nginx
::: tabs
@tab :[logos:ubuntu]:ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```
@tab :[devicon:centos]:centos
```bash
sudo yum install nginx
```
:::

3. Check the Nginx version
```bash
nginx -v
```

4. Start Nginx
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

If you want Nginx to start automatically when the system boots, you can run the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
5. Access Nginx

Nginx usually starts automatically. You can access the default welcome page of Nginx by entering the server's IP address in a browser.

## Install Nginx from Source

1. Install dependencies

Before compiling Nginx, you need to install some necessary dependencies, such as gcc, make, zlib, pcre, and openssl.

::: tabs
@tab :[logos:ubuntu]:ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev
```
@tab :[devicon:centos]:centos
```bash
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" && sudo yum install zlib-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel
```
:::

2. Download Nginx source code

Download the required version of the source code from the Nginx official website.

```bash
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-<version>.tar.gz
```
Replace `version` with the desired Nginx version number.

3. Extract the source code and compile the installation

Use the `tar` command to extract the downloaded source code package, then navigate to the extracted directory. Next, use the `./configure` command to configure the Nginx compilation options, followed by the `make` and `make install` commands to compile and install Nginx.
```bash
tar -zxvf nginx-<version>.tar.gz
cd nginx-<version>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module
make
sudo make install
```

4. Manage Nginx service

After compiling and installing, you can start, stop, restart, and check the status of Nginx using the same methods as with package manager installations. However, note that Nginx installed from source may not be automatically added to the `systemd` service list. You may need to manually create a `systemd` service file to manage it.

::: warning1. Configuration File

The main Nginx configuration file is usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (for CentOS) or `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` (for source compilation). You can adjust the configuration file as needed.

2. Firewall Settings

If the firewall is active, ensure that HTTP and HTTPS traffic is allowed. If Nginx is inaccessible, check your firewall settings.

3. Log Files

Nginx log files are typically located at `/var/log/nginx/` (for CentOS) or `/usr/local/nginx/logs/` (for source compilation). You can check the log files to diagnose issues.

By following the steps above, you should have successfully installed Nginx on your Linux system and can start using it to handle web requests.

## Configure Nginx

1. Create or edit an Nginx configuration file:
   - Nginx configuration files are usually located in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.
   - You can create a new configuration file in this directory or edit the default `default` file.

2. Add server configuration:
   - In the configuration file, you need to add a `server` block to configure your front-end project.
   - Below is a basic configuration example:
```nginx
server {
    listen 9358;
    server_name your-frontend-app.com; # Replace it with your actual domain or IP address.
    root /path/to/your/dist; # Replace it with the actual path to your `dist` folder.
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # Ensure that Vue's routes are correctly mapped to the `index.html` file.
    }

    # If your front-end project needs to call back-end APIs and the back-end APIs are not on the same server, 
    # you can configure a reverse proxy here to forward requests.
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://backend-server-ip:backend-server-port; # Replace it with the actual IP address and port number of your back-end server.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

3. Enable the configuration file:
   - If your configuration file is located in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory, you may need to link it to the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory to enable it.
   - Use the command `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-config-file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` to create the link (replace `your-config-file` with the name of your configuration file).

4. Restart the Nginx service
   1. Test the Nginx configuration:  
      - After modifying the configuration file, you need to test whether the Nginx configuration is correct.
      - Run the command `sudo nginx -t` to test the configuration. If it shows `syntax is ok`, it means there are no syntax errors in the configuration file.
   
   2. Restart the Nginx service:
      - If the configuration is correct, you can use the following commands to restart the Nginx service and apply the changes:
      - For systems using `systemd`: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
      - For systems not using `systemd`: `sudo service nginx reload`

::: warning
1. Permission Issues
   - Ensure that the Nginx user has read permissions for the directory where the front-end project's static files are located.
   - You can modify the directory's permissions or use the `chown` command to change the directory owner.

2. Cross-Origin Issues
   - If your front-end project needs to call back-end APIs and encounters cross-origin issues, you can configure a reverse proxy in Nginx to resolve this problem.
